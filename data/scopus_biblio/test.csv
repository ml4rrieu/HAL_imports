Here we describe the personal histories and clinical evidence of violence and torture among attendees at a public health specialist service in France. Methods: Physicians in a multidisciplinary team conducted examinations to corroborate refugees’ skin lesions and other signs of injury with self-reported histories of physical violence and torture to provide evidence for asylum applications. Results: The 240 asylum seekers assessed between October 2016 and September 2018 were mostly male (89% (213/240)) with median age 29 years (IQR 26–34 years) and originating from north and west Africa. Consultations took place on average 15 months after arrival in France. In most cases (58%) the reason for seeking asylum was political persecution. Almost all attendees (94%) presented with scars. The most common mechanisms of injury were beatings (84%), burns (32%) and cuts/stab wounds (15%). Sexual violence was reported for 37% of women (10/27) and 4% of men (9/213). Police tended to use multiple methods for inflicting injuries, whereas the army and non-state actors mostly inflicted beatings. Sexual violation was most commonly reported for violence inflicted by family members or partners. Corroboration of lesions with patients’ histories of physical violence and torture was affirmative in 93% (224/240) of cases. Conclusion: For this ethnically diverse group, a specialist service which can provide clinical corroboration of self-reported histories of physical violence and torture to support asylum applications is an essential minimum. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine","Asylum seekers; Europe; Refugees; Torture; Violence","adult; Africa; army; Article; asylum seeker; blunt trauma; burn; consultation; controlled study; evidence based practice; family violence; female; France; health service; human; injury; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical specialist; migrant; multidisciplinary team; physical violence; physician; police; politics; public health; refugee; scar; self report; sexual violence; skin defect; stab wound; torture",,,,,,"European council on refugees and exiles (ECRE) (2019), http://www.asylumineurope.org/, Available from: (Accessed 11 February 2020); Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (2004) Istanbul Protocol, , United Nations Geneva; Charlier, P., [Medical anthropology consultations for refugees: why are they necessary?] (2017) Ann Dermatol Venereol, 144 (2), pp. 89-91; Clarysse, K., Grosber, M., Ring, J., Gutermuth, J., Kivlahan, C., Skin lesions, differential diagnosis and practical approach to potential survivors of torture (2019) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 33 (7), pp. 1232-1240; Charlier, P., Dagenais-Everell, C., Two Regards on Forensic Expertises: Crisis of Migrants and Autopsies (2016) Ethics, Medicine and Public Health, 2 (1), pp. 156-158. , 2016/01/01/; Deps, P., Collin, S.M., Aborghetti, H.P., Charlier, P., Clinical forensic dermatology in cases of torture (2020) Br J Dermatol, 183 (4), pp. 773-774; Charlier, P., Haroun, A., Herve, C., Deliberate chemical dermatoglyphic burns in a political refugee (2017) Ann Dermatol Venereol, 144 (2), pp. 130-131; réfugiés-Cosi, F., Country report: France 2017 https://www.forumrefugies.org/, Available from: (Accessed 11 February 2020); Freedman, J., Gendering the International Asylum and Refugee Debate (2007), Palgrave Macmillan UK London; Clement, R., Lebosse, D., Barrios, L., Rodat, O., Asylum seekers alleging torture in their countries: evaluation of a French center (2017) J Forensic Leg Med, 46, pp. 24-29; Freedman, J., Sexual and gender-based violence against refugee women: a hidden aspect of the refugee ""crisis (2016) Reprod Health Matters, 24 (47), pp. 18-26; Tantet, C., Delaporte, C., Cordel, H., [Violence against migrant and refugee women: how to identify them] (2019) Rev Prat, 69 (6), pp. 676-678; Charlier, P., Bou Abdallah, F., Brun, L., [The myth of virgin cleansing: latest news on an archaic magico-religious practice] (2018) Ann Dermatol Venereol, 145 (3), pp. 178-181; Abbott, A., The mental-health crisis among migrants (2016) Nature, 538 (7624), pp. 158-160; Grupp, F., Moro, M.R., Nater, U.M., Skandrani, S.M., Mewes, R., It's that route that makes us sick"": exploring lay beliefs about causes of post-traumatic stress disorder among sub-saharan african asylum seekers in Germany (2018) Front Psychiatr, 9, p. 628; Charlier, P., Duverger, P., Abdallah, F.B., Memory recall of traumatic events in refugees (2018) Lancet, 392 (10160), p. 2170; Gosselin, A., Desgrees du Lou, A., Lelievre, E., Understanding settlement pathways of african immigrants in France through a capability approach: do pre-migratory characteristics matter?
